# Docstrings in Python

In Python, docstrings are used to provide documentation for functions, classes, and modules. A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, or class definition. It is enclosed in triple quotes, either single or double.

## Usage/Examples

```python
def add(x, y):
    """
    Adds two numbers together.

    Args:
        x (int): The first number to add.
        y (int): The second number to add.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y.
    """
    return x + y

```
