# Python-Projects
I will be building new mini projects everyday based on what I'm learning everyday in Python.
All the projects are separated by Day Folder example Day1, Day2 ...
Inside the Every Project folder there are 3 files {Projectname.py}, test.py and readme.py
test.py is used for practice and making logic for main project file.
I make logic of code in block in test.py file (Please ignore it).
