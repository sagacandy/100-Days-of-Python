# 100 days of python
## I'm on Day 28 (Map, Filter & Reduce)
I will be learning python everyday and my commit is 100 days and not miss 1 single day.
All the projects are separated by Day Folder example Day1, Day2 ...
Inside the Every Project folder there are 3 files {Projectname.py}, test.py and readme.py
test.py is used for practice and making logic for main project file.
I make logic of code in block in test.py file (Please ignore it).
Readme.md file contents contains what I learned everyday
