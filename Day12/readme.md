1. "map" is a built-in Python function that allows you to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set, etc.) and return a map object (an iterator) containing the results.

2. The filter function in Python is a built-in function that filters elements from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set, etc.) based on a given condition. It returns a filter object, which is an iterator, containing the elements that meet the condition.

3. The reduce function in Python is a function from the functools module that performs a cumulative operation on the elements of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set, etc.). It takes two arguments: a function and an iterable, and returns a single value.
