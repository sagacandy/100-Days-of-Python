First day I wrote a simple code to find the average of user input numbers making it a dynamic programme:
By building this simple program I learned following topics in Python:

1. User input (ask the user to enter the numbers and make a list)
2. Used while loop to ceate a condition to repeatedly ask the user to enter the numbers unit it's quitted
3. Utilised break statement and else statement
