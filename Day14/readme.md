# Project Rock Paper Scissor in Python

In Day 14 I made a project rock, paper, scissor game played between computer and real player.
I used **random** module in python to choose randomly among rock, paper, scissor

## Usage/Examples

```python
def computer_choice():
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissor']
    return random.choice(choices)
```
