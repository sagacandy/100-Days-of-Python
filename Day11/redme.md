"lambda" is a reserved keyword in Python that represents an anonymous function, or a function without a name. These functions are defined using the "lambda" keyword followed by one or more arguments, a colon, and a single expression that is evaluated and returned when the function is called.

Lambda functions are often used as inputs to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments) or as arguments to built-in functions that expect function objects, such as map(), filter(), and reduce().
